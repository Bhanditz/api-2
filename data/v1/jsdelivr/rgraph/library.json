Heyes ","homepage":"http://www.rgraph.net/","description":"RGraph is a Javascript charts library that uses Javascript and HTML5 to draw and supports over twenty different types of charts. Using the new HTML5 canvas tag, RGraph creates these charts inside the web browser using Javascript, meaning quicker pages and less web server load. This leads to smaller page sizes, lower costs and faster websites - everybody wins! ","mainfile":"","lastversion":"20131231"}
