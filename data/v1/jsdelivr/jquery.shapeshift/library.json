What sets it apart is the ability to drag and drop items within the grid while still maintaining a logical index position for each item. This allows for the grid to be rendered exactly the same every time Shapeshift is used, as long as the child elements are in the correct order.","mainfile":"jquery.shapeshift.min.js","lastversion":"2.0.0"}
